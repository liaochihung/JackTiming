#JackTiming

This is a project just like AndyTiming, based on C# + Wpf + MvvmLight.

As recently I need to draw some simple diagram, I use AndyTiming first, but got problems when showing some characters in windows 10, I decided to write my own.

All the functions are nearly done, enjoy if you needed it!
