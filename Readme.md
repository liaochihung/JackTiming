#JackTiming

This is a project just like AndyTiming.

As recently I need to draw some simple diagram, I use AndyTiming first, but it's some problem when showing some characters in windows 10, I decided to write my own.

This is still in early progress, some features are not implemented, I'll keep going later on.
